This paper presents a joint effort by BUT and Telefónica Research to develop ASR systems for the <a href="https://catedrartve.unizar.es/albayzin2020.html">Albayzin 2020 Speech-to-Text Challenge (S2TC)</a>. The Albayzin S2TC focuses on evaluating ASR systems for broadcast TV shows. In this work, we compare hybrid and end-to-end approaches. A fusion of our best systems achieved 23.33% WER in the official Albayzin 2020 evaluations and 13.3% WER on the Albayzin 2018 evaluation set. Additionally, we discuss efforts to retrieve high-quality transcripts for training.
