In this paper we focused on machine learning inference at mobile networks edge. We show recent advances in Deep Learning has enabled inference in few tens/hundreds of milliseconds even for computing intensive applications (e.g., object detection or speech recognition). As a consequence, we showed network latency is now the main bottleneck in end-to end latency especially when GPU are used.
