Contextual adaptation of ASR is highly beneficial for multi-accent and often noisy Air Traffic Control (ATC) speech, particularly for call-sign recognition, which can be used to track conversations between ATC operators and individual airplanes.
In this work we developed a two-stage boosting strategy: HCLG boosting and Lattice boosting, both implemented as WFST compositions with utterance-specific contextual information.
HCLG boosting applies score discounts to individual words, while Lattice boosting targets word sequences.
Using context data from the OpenSky Network’s surveillance database, we enhance the likelihood of call-signs appearing in ASR’s best hypothesis.
This also improves the accuracy of the NLU module for recognizing call-signs. This work is part of <a href="https://www.atco2.org/">ATCO2 project</a>.
