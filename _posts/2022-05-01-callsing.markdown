Air traffic control relies on speech communication between pilots and controllers, with call-signs as unique flight identifiers.
Extracting call-signs is challenging due to noisy channels and low signal-to-noise ratio, leading to high word error rates.
We propose a system that identifies call-signs in noisy transcripts and converts them to the International Civil Aviation Organization format.
By integrating surveillance data, call-sign accuracy improves up to four times, and data augmentation boosts performance on high error rate transcripts and adapts the model to new airspaces.
