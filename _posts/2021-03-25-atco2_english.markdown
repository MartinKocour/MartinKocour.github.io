Filtering non-English speech is a key step in the data processing pipeline of the <a href="https://www.atco2.org/">ATCO2 project</a>.
We propose an English language detection system using embeddings from a Bayesian subspace multinomial model.
Trained on word confusion networks from an automatic speech recognition system, it is robust, lightweight, and easy to train.
