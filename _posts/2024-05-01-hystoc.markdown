End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems are increasingly popular but often lack well-calibrated word-level confidences. We propose Hystoc, a simple method to derive word-level confidences from hypothesis-level scores. Hystoc aligns n-best outputs into a confusion network, where word-level confidences are computed as posterior probabilities. Our experiments show that Hystoc provides well-correlated confidence estimates and boosts the effectiveness of system fusion, improving word error rate by up to 1% absolute on the Spanish RTVE2020 dataset. While direct fusion of n-best outputs from similar systems yields minor gains, Hystoc proves valuable in broader fusion scenarios.
